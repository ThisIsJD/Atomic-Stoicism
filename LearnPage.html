                            Stoicism began around 300 BCE in Athens, founded by Zeno of Citium. He started teaching his ideas at a public place called the Stoa Poikile, which is how Stoicism got its name. Zeno taught that the path to happiness is found in accepting life as it is and focusing on what we can control.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over time, Stoicism spread and became popular with many important thinkers. Seneca, a Roman philosopher, focused on practical advice for everyday life and how to stay calm in stressful times. Epictetus, a former slave turned teacher, emphasized that our reactions to events matter more than the events themselves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The most famous Stoic is Marcus Aurelius, a Roman emperor. His personal writings, known as Meditations, are filled with reflections on how to live a good life, remain humble, and handle hardships with strength. These thinkers helped shape Stoicism into a timeless philosophy that is still relevant today.

                        <h3>Zeno of Citium</h3>
                        <p>
                            Born around 334 BCE, is the founder of Stoicism. Originally a merchant, Zeno became interested in philosophy after surviving a shipwreck and reading philosophical works in Athens. He studied under different teachers before developing his own ideas. Zeno started teaching at a public place called the Stoa Poikile (Painted Porch), where Stoicism got its name.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Zeno’s Stoic philosophy focused on living in harmony with nature, self-control, and accepting things beyond our control. His teachings laid the foundation for Stoicism, promoting the idea that happiness comes from virtue, not external goods or wealth. Zeno’s influence lasted long after his time and shaped Stoicism as it spread across the Roman Empire.

                        <p>
                            Born in 121 CE, was a Roman emperor and one of the most famous Stoic philosophers. Despite his powerful role, he practiced Stoicism and focused on living with humility, patience, and self-discipline. His personal writings, Meditations, were reflections on how to live a virtuous life, manage hardships, and stay calm in the face of adversity.                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As an emperor, Marcus Aurelius faced many challenges, including wars and personal losses, but his Stoic principles helped him lead with wisdom and inner strength. Meditations remains one of the most important works on Stoic philosophy, offering guidance on how to deal with life’s difficulties while staying true to one’s values.

                        <p>
                            Seneca, born around 4 BCE, was a Roman philosopher, statesman, and one of the key figures in Stoicism. He served as an advisor to Emperor Nero but is best known for his philosophical writings. Seneca’s work focused on practical advice for overcoming anger, fear, and other emotions, emphasizing that a calm and rational mind leads to a virtuous life.                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Seneca believed that true wealth comes from inner peace, not material success, and that by focusing on self-improvement and moral virtue, we can live better lives. His letters and essays continue to influence those looking to apply Stoic principles in modern life, especially in dealing with stress and adversity.

                            Born around 55 CE, was a Greek philosopher who began life as a slave in Rome before gaining his freedom and becoming a respected teacher of Stoicism. His teachings were recorded by his student, Arrian, in the Discourses and Enchiridion, where Epictetus emphasized that we should focus only on what we can control—our thoughts, actions, and reactions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Epictetus believed that external events are not within our power, but how we respond to them is. This focus on inner strength and self-discipline became central to Stoic thought. His teachings have inspired people for centuries, encouraging them to live virtuously, regardless of circumstances.
